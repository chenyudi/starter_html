        <p>My professors asked us to make the Guacamole in the first class to taste it because it's easy to prepare and can be customized to suit different tastes.</p>

        <h3>Recipe Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 ripe avocados</li>
            <li>1 small onion, finely diced</li>
            <li>2 Roma (plum) tomatoes, diced</li>
            <li>1-2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1-2 jalapeño peppers, minced (adjust to your preferred level of spiciness)</li>
            <li>Juice of 1-2 limes (adjust to taste)</li>
            <li>1/4 cup fresh cilantro leaves, chopped</li>
            <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Recipe Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the Avocados: Cut the avocados in half, remove the seeds, and scoop the flesh into a mixing bowl.</li>
            <li>Mash the Avocados: Use a fork or potato masher to mash the avocado to your desired level of chunkiness.</li>
            <li>Add the Aromatics: Add the finely diced onion, minced garlic, and minced jalapeño peppers to the mashed avocado.</li>
            <li>Add the Tomatoes: Gently fold in the diced tomatoes. If you prefer a less watery guacamole, you can remove the seeds and pulp from the tomatoes before dicing.</li>
            <li>Season: Squeeze the lime juice over the mixture to add flavor and help prevent the avocados from browning. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste.</li>
            <li>Add Cilantro: Fold in the chopped fresh cilantro for a burst of freshness and flavor.</li>
            <li>Optional Seasonings: If desired, you can add ground cumin, chili powder, or paprika for additional flavor.</li>
            <li>Chill and Serve: Cover the guacamole with plastic wrap, ensuring the wrap is in direct contact with the guacamole to minimize browning. Refrigerate for about 30 minutes to let the flavors meld.</li>
        </ol>

        <ul>
            <li>4-6 large eggs</li>
            <li>200 grams (about 7 ounces) of ground meat </li>

            <li>2 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>

            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>Chopped green onions or cilantro for garnish (optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Recipe Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place the eggs in a saucepan and cover them with cold water. Bring the water to a boil over high heat.</li>
            <li>Once boiling, reduce the heat to low, cover the saucepan, and let the eggs simmer for about 9-12 minutes for hard-boiled eggs or less time for softer yolks.</li>
            <li>After cooking, transfer the eggs to a bowl of ice water to cool quickly.</li>
            <li>Once cooled, peel the eggs and set them aside.</li>
            <li>In a separate skillet or pan, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Add the chopped onion and minced garlic, and sauté until they become fragrant and translucent about 2-3 minutes.</li>

            <li>Stir in the soy sauce, sugar, and a pinch of salt and pepper. Adjust the seasoning to your taste.</li>
            <li>Cook for an additional 2-3 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.</li>
            <li>Pour in the chicken or vegetable broth, and bring the mixture to a simmer.</li>
            <li>Let it simmer for about 5-7 minutes, allowing the broth to reduce slightly and thicken.</li>
            <li>Gently place the peeled eggs into the simmering meat and broth mixture. Spoon some of the liquid over the eggs to coat them.</li>
            <li>Continue to simmer for an additional 5-7 minutes, allowing the eggs to absorb the flavors of the sauce.</li>
            <li>Spoon the meat and sauce over the eggs.</li>
